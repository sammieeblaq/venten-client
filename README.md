NB: For the purpose of this project i focused more on function over form. Therefore there is almost no styling done in the project.

Upon click of the ADD PRODUCT button a new product would be added the database via the API.
GET PRODUCT button gets all the products added in the order of Last in First Out (LIFO), Which means the last product added would be the first to display when getting all the products.

As such the last task to display a preview page was a bit of a challenge to me, hence i could get the data but couldn't get it to display like the task showed.

Thank you for this great opportunity afforded me, I have definately learnt a lot from this task.
